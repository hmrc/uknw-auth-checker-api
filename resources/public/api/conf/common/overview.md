This API allows Community System Providers (CSPs) to check if traders have a valid Notification of Presentation (NOP) Waiver authorisation, using their EORI number. This waiver is necessary to enable the transit of Not At Risk (NAR) goods moving through from Great Britain (GB) to Northern Ireland (NI). The API follows RESTful principles and has a single POST method endpoint that returns the data in JSON format. It uses standard HTTP error response codes.

For information on how to connect to this API [see the Notice of Presentation Waiver Checker Service Guide](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/guides/uknw-auth-checker-api-service-guide/).
