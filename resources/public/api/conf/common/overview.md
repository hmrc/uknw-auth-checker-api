This API allows Community System Providers (CSPs) to check if traders' have a valid Notification of Presentation (NOP) Waiver authorisation using their EORI number. This waiver is necessary to enable the transit of Not At Risk (NAR) goods moving through from Great Britain (GB) to Northern Ireland (NI). The API follows RESTful principles and has a single POST method endpoint that returns the data in JSON format. It uses standard HTTP error response codes.
